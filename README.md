# eShop
This is eShop, Currently I am building a product store using react and a external API. This Application will allow users to login and shop around for products they are intrested in buying. They have the ability to add products to their cart or remove them. Users always have the ability to filter out certain products by category, price and rating. (This project is just for learning purposes and I'm still currently developing the application.) If you decide to use the application feel free to give me feedback!

# Stack used for the application is:
React.js frontend,
Redux,
Material UI,
HTML,
CSS,
FakeStore API,
Async, Thunk, Actions, Reducers,
etc..

# Installation

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
